#  Mood Detector: AI-Powered Emotion Analysis ðŸ§ 

I recently completed a **web-based application** designed to test a machine learning model capable of detecting human emotions from text input. This app combines **AI technology** with a seamless user experience to identify emotional states and recommend relevant places to match the user's mood.

## ðŸ’¡ Technologies Used:

### **For Model Development (NLP):**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques were used to preprocess and analyze text data.
- **TensorFlow**: For training and deploying the deep learning model.
- **Keras Tokenizer**: For text tokenization and sequence padding.
- **Word Embedding**: To represent textual data numerically for input into the model.
- **Categorical Encoding**: For converting mood labels into numerical formats.

### **For the Web Application:**
- **Streamlit**: For developing the interactive web-based interface.
- **Pandas**: For processing cafe recommendation data stored in CSV files.
- **Plotly**: For creating engaging and interactive visualizations.

## Purpose:

- This web-based app serves as a testing platform for the mood detection model and cafe recommendations.
- The final model, along with the cafe and mood recommendation system, will be integrated into a **mobile application** for a more comprehensive and user-friendly experience.

## Conclusion:

This project demonstrates how **AI, machine learning, NLP, and creative data utilization** can work together to enhance emotional awareness and deliver personalized solutions. By combining technical expertise with thoughtful design, this application bridges the gap between technology and human emotion.
