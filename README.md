# ðŸŒˆ Mood Detector: AI-Powered Emotion Analysis ðŸ§ 

I recently completed a **web-based application** designed to test a machine learning model capable of detecting human emotions from text input. This app combines **AI technology** with a seamless user experience to identify emotional states and recommend relevant places to match the user's mood.

## âœ¨ Key Features:

- **Accurate Mood Detection**: The app detects 6 mood categories (Sadness, Joy, Love, Anger, Fear, Surprise) and visualizes confidence scores for each mood.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Based on the detected mood, it suggests cafes aligned with the user's emotional state, providing details such as names, ratings, reviews, and addresses.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Confidence levels for each mood are displayed dynamically through interactive bar charts.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Streamlit**, the app offers a simple yet intuitive experience for mood analysis.

## ðŸ“‚ Data Structure:

### **cafe-data**
- This folder contains CSV files, each representing a mood (e.g., `joy_caffe.csv`, `sadness_caffe.csv`, etc.).
- Each file includes data about cafes that match a specific mood, with columns such as:
  - **Name**
  - **Rating**
  - **Reviews**
  - **Address**
  - **Price Range**
  - **Category**
  - **Atmosphere**
- The application reads these files to provide personalized recommendations based on the predicted mood.

### **mood-data**
- This folder contains quotes and motivational messages categorized by mood.
- Quotes are displayed after a mood is detected, enhancing the user experience with an emotional touch.
- Example: For a detected mood of *Joy*, the app might display an uplifting quote to complement the recommendations.

## ðŸ’¡ Technologies Used:

### **For Model Development (NLP):**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques were used to preprocess and analyze text data.
- **TensorFlow**: For training and deploying the deep learning model.
- **Keras Tokenizer**: For text tokenization and sequence padding.
- **Word Embedding**: To represent textual data numerically for input into the model.
- **Categorical Encoding**: For converting mood labels into numerical formats.

### **For the Web Application:**
- **Streamlit**: For developing the interactive web-based interface.
- **Pandas**: For processing cafe recommendation data stored in CSV files.
- **Plotly**: For creating engaging and interactive visualizations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:

- This web-based app serves as a testing platform for the mood detection model and cafe recommendations.
- The final model, along with the cafe and mood recommendation system, will be integrated into a **mobile application** for a more comprehensive and user-friendly experience.

## ðŸš€ Conclusion:

This project demonstrates how **AI, machine learning, NLP, and creative data utilization** can work together to enhance emotional awareness and deliver personalized solutions. By combining technical expertise with thoughtful design, this application bridges the gap between technology and human emotion.
